## Problem Definition

Many individuals struggle to find neighborhoods that align with their lifestyle preferences. Existing platforms focus on limited factors like price and commute, overlooking more personal aspects such as safety, walkability, and nightlife. Our goal is to match users to neighborhoods based on their real-world lifestyle priorities.

## Competitive Analysis

- **Zillow**: Focuses mainly on housing prices and listings, lacks deep lifestyle filtering.
- **Niche.com**: Offers rankings, but little customization or user-driven matching.
- **AreaVibes**: Scoring system exists but not interactive or personalized.
